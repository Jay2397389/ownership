# üêî Polloshook ‚Äî Official Update Repository

This is the **official update repository** for **Polloshook**, a Java-based application that supports automatic updates.

The repository hosts versioned binary files that the client downloads and applies to stay up to date. This system allows for lightweight, efficient updates without requiring manual downloads or full reinstalls.

## üîÑ How Polloshook Auto-Updating Works

1. On startup, the Polloshook client checks this repository for new `.bin` files.
2. If newer versions are found, the client downloads them and applies the update.
3. The update process may overwrite existing files or expand new ones, depending on the versioning logic.
4. Once updated, the client restarts or refreshes its state.

## ‚úÖ Trust & Transparency

This project is committed to being:

* Open,
* Easy to audit,
* Developer-friendly.
